		<p>This is — by far — my favorite aspect of working at GitHub. Everything is
asynchronous.</p>

<h2>Chat</h2>

<p>GitHub didn&rsquo;t have an office for the first two years. Chat rooms (in our case,
<a href="http://campfirenow.com">Campfire</a>) is where things got done. Today we&rsquo;ve moved into our
second office, and Campfire is <em>still</em> where we get things done. There&rsquo;s a
reason for that: chat is asynchronous.</p>

<p>Asynchronous communication means I can take a step out for lunch and catch up
on transcripts when I get back. Asynchronous communication means I can ask my
coworker a question in-chat and not worry about bothering her since she&rsquo;ll get
back to me when she&rsquo;s available. Asynchronous communication means I can go to
rural Minnesota and feel like I&rsquo;m working from the office like normal.</p>

		<h2>Pull Requests</h2>

<p>The majority of our development workflow involves <a href="https://github.com/features/projects/codereview#codereview_bucket">Pull Requests</a>. I&rsquo;m
going to be going into a lot more detail about this in future blog posts <a href="http://zachholman.com/talks">and
talks</a> but in the meantime let me say this: living in a pull request
world is sublime.  Gone are days at companies with complicated branching
strategies, with in-person code-on-a-screen code review.</p>

<p>If I want to add a new feature or impact the codebase, I&rsquo;ll push a new branch,
create a Pull Request for it, and my coworkers will review it 1) if they&rsquo;re
impacted by those changes, 2) interested in the subject, or 3) when they have
ample time to check out my changes. At that point, we can run a partial deploy
of that branch on different subsets of machines and try things out in
production, and if everything looks good, merge into master.</p>

<p>With Pull Requests, I don&rsquo;t have to drag anyone into a meeting that&rsquo;s
inconvenient for them and for me. There&rsquo;s a good reason for that, too:</p>
